<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">As an experienced system dynamics user (or if you've just read "</span><a class="rvts11" href="Newtosystemdynamics.html">New to system dynamics?</a><span class="rvts6">"), what you need to know is what's does Minsky provide that other system dynamics programs don't. That boils down to one feature: The Godley Table that enables a dynamic model of financial flows to be derived from a table that is very similar to the accountant's double-entry bookkeeping table.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The dynamics in financial flows </span><span class="rvts12">could</span><span class="rvts6"> be modeled using the flowchart paradigm. But it would also be very, very easy to make a mistake modeling financial flows in such a system, for one simple reason: every financial flow needs to be entered at least twice in a system--once as a source, and once as a sink.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">For example, if you go shopping and buy a new computer with your credit card, you increase your debt to a bank and simultaneously increase the deposit account of the retailer from whom you buy the computer. The two system states in this model--your credit card ("BuyerCredit") and the retailer's deposit account ("SellerDeposit")--therefore have to have the same entry (let's call this "Card") made into them. In Vissim, such a transaction would look like this:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img width="489" height="99" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem11.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">That would work, but there's nothing in the program that warns you if you make a mistake like, for example, wiring up the BuyerCredit entry, but forgetting the SellerDeposit one:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img width="489" height="99" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem12.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Or, perhaps, wiring up both blocks, but giving one the wrong sign:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem51.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In a very complex model, you might make a mistake like one of the above, run the simulation and get nonsense results, and yet be unable to locate your mistake.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Minsky avoids this problem by using the paradigm that accountants developed half a millennium ago to keep financial accounts accurately: double-entry bookkeeping. Here is the same model in Minsky:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem13.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This is an inherently better way to generate a dynamic model of financial flows, for at least two reasons:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">All financial transactions are flows between entities. The tabular layout captures this in a very natural way: each row shows where a flow originates, and where it ends up</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The program adopts the accounting practice of double-entry bookkeeping, in which entries on each row sum to zero. The source is shown as a "+", the sink is shown as a "-", and assets are shown as a positive sum while liabilities are shown as a negative. If you don't ensure that each flow starts somewhere and ends somewhere--say you make the same mistake as in the flowchart examples above, then the program will identify your mistake.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you forget to enter the recipient in this transaction, then the Row Sum identifies your mistake by showing that the row sums to "Card" rather than zero:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem52.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">And it also identifies if you give the wrong sign to one entry:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem53.png"/></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Minsky thus adds an element to the system dynamics toolkit which is fundamental for modeling the monetary flows that are an intrinsic aspect of a market economy. Future releases will dramatically extend this capability.</span></p>
